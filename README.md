# -Smokin-Ball
‘Smokin’ Ball’ is a plain, smooth game with a solid paddle (slider), one ball and an array of bricks arranged in a complex manner waiting to be destroyed by the fiery ball. The movement of the paddle enables the user to prevent the ball from leaving the bottom part of the screen.


After the code is compiled and run, the game window is opened. The user can see the window titled as ‘Smokin’ Ball’ with a sweet little game icon.
The interactive Start Screen is displayed on the window with buttons ready to be clicked. The user sees the “Play”, “Guidance” and “Exit” buttons which function exactly as they sound.
Upon clicking on the “Guidance” button, a set of instructions are advertised. The instructions are written in a basic way, solely to help an amateur. On the displayed screen, the user sees a button titled “Go Back”, which brings the user back to the Start Screen.
Upon clicking on the “Play” button, the user is brought to the game arena. The user sees a slider with a ball stuck to it, waiting to be released by the ‘Spacebar’, as indicated by the message on the screen. Once the ‘Spacebar’ is pressed, the game begins with the “Score” initially set to zero and “Lives” set to three. The destruction of one brick results into the user being awarded five points. Also, if the ball touches the bottom of the screen, the “Live(s)” is decremented by one. Want to receive a call or want to have a quick bite of your cheese sandwich? With the ‘Pause’ feature, which gets activated upon pressing the button “P”, the game pauses and a message is showcased which enables the user to continue by pressing “C” and to quit by pressing “Q”. An encouraging message, along with “Game Over”, is exhibited when the user loses all his lives. After completing the game, a complimentary messaged is displayed.

I developed this game as part of Python Project in !st sem
